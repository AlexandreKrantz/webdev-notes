# Coding Notes
Hello there, welcome to my coding notes. These notes are a pretty good reflection of the coding I've done since May 2022. 
All the notes are in markdown, so you can view them directly on GitHub.  
There are 3 main folders worth exploring:
- `web-dev` has all my personal learning notes. This includes *JavaScript* and the *NodeJS* environments. It also has notes on frameworks/libraries I've picked up such as *TypeScript*, WebAssembly, etc. 
- `comp303` has the notes from a university class I'm taking currently (winter 2023) on Software Design. It covers different design patterns and practices in *Java*.  
- `comp302` has the notes from a class I took last fall (2022) about Functional Programming with *OCaml*. 
- `comp251` is a class I'm currently taking on data structures and algorithms with *Java*.  

Also, it's worth noting that last year I took classes on Assembly Programming (with *MIPS*) and Unix Systems (*bash*, *C*). 
My detailed knowledge of Assembly has faded away (if it was evern there in the first place), but I would say that I still have good working proficiency in bash and C. 
Thanks for stopping by!
