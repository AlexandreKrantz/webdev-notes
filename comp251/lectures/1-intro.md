Non linear data structures: trees, heaps, maps, graphs. 

- Data type (list, stack, queue)
- Data structure (array, heap, hash tables) = a way to store and organize data; supports efficient insertions, queries, searches, updates, and delete.
	- linear data structure = array, linked list
	- non-linear data structures = graphs, union-find structures, segment tree
- basic data structure =  built in to the language
- other data strcture =  separate library


Red-black tree = balanced binary search tree

Heap means value of a node is greater than or equal to value of children.
Complete binary tree means last row is populated from left to right. 

Hash tables = content-based retrieval 
keys -> hashing function -> buckets
