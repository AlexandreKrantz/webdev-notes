## Complete Search
- Aka brute force or backtracking. 
- Search up to the entire search space for a solution. 
- Applies only when search space is finite. 
- Backtracking can be described as an organized exhaustive search which often avoids searching all possibilities.

Try out all possible solutions, pick up desired solutions. 

Backtracking can be done using a state space tree.

## Divide and Conquer
- Break problem into smaller sub-problems. The sub-problems should be the same as the original, just on a smaller sample. Combine the solutions of the sub-problems to solve the original problem. 
	- Examples: mergesort, etc. 

## Decrease and Conquer
- Sometimes weâ€™re not actually dividing the problem into many subproblems, but only into one smaller subproblem
	- Example: Binary search
