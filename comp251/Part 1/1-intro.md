Non linear data structures: 

- Abstract data type (list, stack, queue)
- Data structure (array, heap, hash tables) = a way to insert and organize data; supports efficient insertions, queries, searches, updates, and delete.
	- linear data structure = array, linked list
	- non-linear data structures = union-find structures, trees, heaps, maps, graphs. 
- "basic" data structure =>  built in to the language
	- other data strctures are separate libraries

- **Red-black tree** is balanced binary search tree
- **Heap** just means value of a node is greater than or equal to value of children.
- **Complete binary tree** means last row is populated from left to right. 

- A **Hash table** is a content-based retrieval system
	- Content has an associated key
	- keys -> hashing function -> buckets
