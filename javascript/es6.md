## ECMAScript info 
- **ES6 and ES2015 are the same thing**: a significant JS update that happened in 2015. Prior to its release all major JS versions were named ES1, ES2, etc. With its release the naming changed to include the year in the name.
	- ES2016 is basically ES7, ES2017 is basically ES8
- **ECMAScript** is a standard. **JavaScript** is the most popular _implementation_ of that standard. Other implementations include: [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) (Firefox), [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_V8) (Chrome), and [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript).
	- ES is just an abbreviation for ECMAScript and updates to ES are updates to the overall JS standard.
	- Browsers don't implement all of the new standard at the same time. At the current time all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) support _all_ of ES6, and _most_ of ES7, but older browsers (various versions of Internet Explorer for instance) do not.
- Sometimes people write ES.Next to refer to the next (unreleased) version of ES. 
- `let`, `const`, classes, destructuring, rest params, for-of loops are [all things that were introduced with ES2015]([lukehoban/es6features: Overview of ECMAScript 6 features (github.com)](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)).
